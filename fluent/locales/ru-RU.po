"    Seamless translation between two languages in one channel. Or manual translation to various languages.\n\n"
"    Fluent uses google translate by default, with [Flowery](https://flowery.pw/) as a fallback.\n\n"
"    Fluent also supports the [Deepl](https://www.deepl.com/pro#developer) tranlsation api.\n"
"    1. Register your free Deepl account **[Here](https://www.deepl.com/pro#developer)**.\n"
"    2. Obtain your API key **[Here](https://www.deepl.com/account/summary)**.\n"
"    3. Set your API key with:\n"
"    `[p]set api deepl key YOUR_KEY_HERE`\n\n"
"    If a deepl key is set, it will use that before falling back to google translate and then flowery.\n"
